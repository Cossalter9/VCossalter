- 🚀 I'm interested in evolving as a programmer, I don't work in the field yet... Looking for new opportunities!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics of programming concepts.
- 😊 I’m looking to collaborate on the best way I can, I'm still a beginner, so I won't be able to be of much help hehehe, but I intend to strive to help others, and of course, become a great programmer.
